Finals Quiz 1

Score: 38/50

Corrections:
Question 1: B Because the number of statements in a program is not likely to affect how a program will handle larger data sets. The efficiency of a program is independent of the number of statements it contains. There are some programs with very few statements that take a long time to execute, as well as programs with many statements that take little time to execute.

Question 3: B Becuse it allows for determining the likelihood that the photo was taken at a particular public event.

Question 4: This would be A because one way to accomplish network redundancy is by having more than one path between any two connected devices. Redundancy within a network allows it to support failures and still continue to function.

Question 8: A, by storing information about each call, the company can use machine learning and data mining and thereby make business decisions based on their customers’ needs.

Question 9: B Because the company is not able to provide a human representative for calls made after business hours.

Question 12: A or I only because an audio signal of the customer’s voice is needed when the customer describes the issue in the upgraded system. It is not needed in the original system. The customer’s keypad selection is used in the original system but not in the upgraded system. The customer’s phone number is captured in upgraded system; however, it is not needed to direct a call to the appropriate destination.

Question 26: C becuase to determine the topics that many users are posting about is the best way to choose.

Question 28: D There are trade-offs involved in choosing a compression technique for storing and transmitting data.

Question 29: C Because the variable sum is initialized to store the value of the first element of numList, and because the iteration block is a FOR EACH loop, the value of the first element is added to sum twice. Since the first element of the list is 0, adding this number to the sum does not affect the sum. A non-zero first element would give an incorrect result. In general, a single test case is not sufficient to confirm that a program works as intended.

Question 34: B because the Internet is considered fault-tolerant because messages can often be transmitted even in the presence of network failures. This is achieved by using redundant routing, which means that there are usually multiple possible paths between devices.

Question 42: 1001 0100 or A becuase that is the order of binary corsponding to the tabel

Question 43: C because the user is sent an e-mail appearing to be from the manufacturer, asking the user to confirm the account password by clicking on a link in the e-mail and entering the password on the resulting page.

Corrections:
Question 4: B because the digital divide describes the differences in access to computing devices and the Internet. Requiring job applicants to apply online serves only individuals who already have access to computing devices and the Internet. It does not help reduce the divide.

Question 14: A because the two line graphs are roughly the same shape. Each value on the right line graph is about 10 times the corresponding value on the left line graph. Therefore, the average amount of data stored per user is about 10 GB.

Question 22: B because IPv6 allows for a greater number of IP addresses than IPv4 does, which allows more devices to be connected.

Question 24: The correct answer is C because if a particular device or connection on the Internet fails, subsequent data will be sent via a different route, if possible. This is supported by redundancy in the network.

Question 25: C because the application can be used to connect users with other nearby users, which may encourage users to exercise together. This may have the effect of improving user health.

Question 30: C because the application can be used to connect users with other nearby users, which may encourage users to exercise together. This may have the effect of improving user health.

Question 31: A because the binary number 11111111 is equal to 27+26+25+24+23+22+21+20, or 255. The binary number 11110000 is equal to 27+26+25+24, or 240. Therefore, the given binary triplet represents the color ivory.

Question 32: D because four bits can represent 24, or 16 pieces of information.

Question 40: D because citizen science involves members of the general public participating in scientific research. Distributing the image analysis work to a larger group of individuals allows the work to be completed in less time.

Corrections:
Question 2: D, an undecidable problem is one for which no algorithm can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer. Some instances of an undecidable problem may have an algorithmic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem.

Question 4: D because devices on the Internet communicate using standard protocols, which do not depend on the manufacturer.

Question 7: D because the procedure initially sets result to 1 and j to 2. In the REPEAT UNTIL loop, result is first assigned the sum of result and j, or 1 + 2. The value of j is then increased to 3. In each subsequent iteration of the loop, result is increased by each successive value of j (3, 4, 5, etc.) until j exceeds n. Therefore, the procedure returns the sum of the integers from 1 to n.

Question 15: D because During initial program development, documentation can allow the writer to organize his or her thinking, state assumptions about input, and explain the path of future development. When modifications are made to existing programs, documentation is used to record the changes or additions to an existing program.

Question 17: Options C and D is the correct order of the list.

Question 18: C because the procedure traverses this list and eventually encounters the positive value 1. At this point, the procedure returns true when it should return false because the list does not contain only positive values.

Question 21: D because a strong password is something that is easy for a user to remember but would be difficult for someone else to guess based on knowledge of that user. Weak passwords can often be guessed based on publicly available information about a user. Other weak passwords (such as "password" or "1234") can often be guessed because they are commonly used.

Question 23: D because its the average number of characters per message appears to decrease after the mobile app was released.

Question 26: B because in all four grids, the robot starts along the side of a black region. Step 1 moves the robot just past the end of the black region. Step 2 rotates the robot to the right and moves it forward, placing the robot along the next side of the black region. Step 3 will repeat steps 1 and 2 to move the robot around the other 3 sides to complete a circuit around the black region.

Question 27: B because it shows to be counted, the value of genre must be "talk" and the value of day must be "Saturday" or "Sunday".

Question 36: D because when numCorrect is 6, the condition numCorrect > 7 evaluates to false. Therefore "check" is displayed instead of the intended "check minus".

Question 39: B because it would be the total number of registered users appears to be increasing by about 0.5 million each year, so in year 12, the number of users can be approximated at 31.2 million (30.2 + 0.5 + 0.5).

Question 44: D because The procedures square and cube are each used to determine a power of n. A generalization of this procedure is Power, open parenthesis, n comma m, close parenthesis, which calculates n raised to the m power.

Question 46: B, symmetric encryption because the secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of messages.

Question 47: D because This code segment sets bonus to 0 when score < 50, sets bonus to score * 10 when score > 100, and sets bonus to score when 100 ≥ score ≥ 50.

Question 50: A, the variable first is initially assigned the value 100 and the variable second is initially assigned the value 200. Next, temp is assigned the value of first, which is 100. Next, second is assigned the value of temp, which is 100. Last, first is assigned the value of second, which is 100. After execution, both first and second have the value 100.
