Watch The video

Ok

Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you.

The video shows a man not being able to unlock his computer I think this is becuase of the computers AI and sensoring. This was not the computer being bias but it just  a function that went wrong.

What about Del Norte Crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with Crowdsourcing?

I think that my final project could be better with croudsourcing and help others aswell. Like in the prevous question I can make someone on github or even its own have so it looks more professinal then the google docs.
