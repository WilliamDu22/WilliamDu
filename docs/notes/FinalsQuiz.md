Score: 38/50

Corrections:
Question 1: B Because the number of statements in a program is not likely to affect how a program will handle larger data sets. The efficiency of a program is independent of the number of statements it contains. There are some programs with very few statements that take a long time to execute, as well as programs with many statements that take little time to execute.

Question 3: B Becuse it allows for determining the likelihood that the photo was taken at a particular public event.

Question 4: This would be A because one way to accomplish network redundancy is by having more than one path between any two connected devices. Redundancy within a network allows it to support failures and still continue to function.

Question 8: A, by storing information about each call, the company can use machine learning and data mining and thereby make business decisions based on their customers’ needs.

Question 9: B Because the company is not able to provide a human representative for calls made after business hours.

Question 26: C becuase to determine the topics that many users are posting about is the best way to choose.

Question 28: D There are trade-offs involved in choosing a compression technique for storing and transmitting data.

Question 29: C Because the variable sum is initialized to store the value of the first element of numList, and because the iteration block is a FOR EACH loop, the value of the first element is added to sum twice. Since the first element of the list is 0, adding this number to the sum does not affect the sum. A non-zero first element would give an incorrect result. In general, a single test case is not sufficient to confirm that a program works as intended.

Question 34: B because the Internet is considered fault-tolerant because messages can often be transmitted even in the presence of network failures. This is achieved by using redundant routing, which means that there are usually multiple possible paths between devices.

Question 42: 1001 0100 or A becuase that is the order of binary corsponding to the tabel

Question 43: C because the user is sent an e-mail appearing to be from the manufacturer, asking the user to confirm the account password by clicking on a link in the e-mail and entering the password on the resulting page.
