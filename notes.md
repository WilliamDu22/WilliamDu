Actions:

1. How does someone empower themselves in a digital world?

You can empower yourself my experimenting with new technologies and also doing your own leaning about it. There is tons to learn about computing and how everting works.

2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

Someone thing I can do at Del Norte is I can talk to someone that might be intense in computing. I have a decent knowledge because I've taken Computer Science and I could just explain some topics they want to know and might find interesting.

3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

Yes, I think that the red tape does block digital empowerment. There are barriers at Del Norte blocking cites that we try and go to. Some of these site could have good information we cant view. If you own a router you can mess around in the settings as an admin and block sites and applications as well.
