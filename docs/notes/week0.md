Someone thing I can do at Del Norte is I can talk to someone that might be intense in computing. I have a decent knowledge because I've taken Computer Science and I could just explain some topics they want to know and might find interesting.

3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

Yes, I think that the red tape does block digital empowerment. There are barriers at Del Norte blocking cites that we try and go to. Some of these site could have good information we cant view. If you own a router you can mess around in the settings as an admin and block sites and applications as well.
